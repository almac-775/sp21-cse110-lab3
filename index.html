                Today I was baited by FTSpeed, an automotive shop dealing with aftermarket parts.
                I was so excited to open the box but it turned that they only shipped the lights themselves.

                <strong>Where the fuck are my bumper covers and wiring harness!??</strong> 
                <br>
                In any case, at least I can allocate more time towards my hw.
                Oh right, I also started watching Code Lyoko again!
                This wave of nostalgia hit my like a truck and I teeared up just a bit.
                My favorite childhood show is finally upscaled to 1080p and on Netflix.
                Still a bit of a blurry mess, but can't expect too much from a show that's nearly two decades old now.

                Today could've been spent better. I feel like my memory is getting worse and worse as time progresses.
                I can't tell whether or not I'm not paying enough attention or that I can't allocate my time properly.
                
                <br>

                Still I'm glad I was able to hang out with the homies tonight. Maybe a quick snack was all I needed to de-stress from 101 Quiz 1.
                Honestly I was scared shitless driving in the night with the broken mirror. 
                I'm not sure how I managed to get to and fro safely, but at least I did.
                I'll need to wake up early tomorrow and go to John's house to get my mirror replaced.

                I feel really proud of myself today. I managed to install the dash cam mostly on my own without John's help!
                I did however ask for his guidance to route the mini-usb cable cleanly to the outlet, and he did help with some plastic trim pieces.
                All in all, it wasn't so bad as I expected. I guess the scariest part is the trim breaking. Airbag shouldn't go off at all.

                <br>

                Wonder if I did spend too much time hanging out with him though. I have work to do, and not to mention the CSE 110 meeting too.
                Good thing I wasn't late or anything.

                <br>

                CSE 110 folk seem to be super nice. I like em. Could've sworn I saw Kyle somewhere before.
                Maybe CAT? I think he was in my discussion section and we went to a concert toegether before for one of our assignments.

                <br>

                I still haven't gotten an email back from FTSpeed yet. <b>WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK BRUH</b>

                <br>

                I'm missing items that I paid a large sum of money for, and they're just straight up ignoring me.
                When I bought my SARD spoiler the process was so smooth. How the fuck are fog lights such a hassle?
                My tC foglights are from the same brand and everything was packaged in the same box when I ordered those.

                <br>

                Look how sad this is!!

                    <p>
                        These are Winjet fog lights for 2017-2020 Toyota GT86. I originally wanted them to
                        be yellow, but no manufacturer are selling them tinted, and I don't have enough
                        experience to swap out the factory bulb for a yellow one.
